## 1. Project Description
This project is a daily planner that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day between 9am and 5pm. The user can save events for each hour of the day by clicking into the time block and typing in the event and then clicking the save button. These notes will be saved in local storage. The time blocks are color coded to indicate whether the time block is in the past, present, or future. The future hours are in green, the present hour is in red, and the past hours are in gray. The user can also refresh the page and the saved events will persist. The current date is projected on the top of the page under the header.
